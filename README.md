# Facebook-hacker-

"Hello, I present to you one of the best guessing tools. This tool works by guessing through a personal Facebook link. When you enter a Facebook link, the tool will ask you for the path of the password.txt file. You can create a password list file with the passwords you want. Then, enter the personal Facebook link of the target. The tool will start guessing the password for the specified account. If you don't want to create a password file, you can use my password.txt file provided with the tool, and you can change it whenever you want. Just create a password list and name it password.txt, then replace the original file with yours. Good luck!

Installation instructions for the tool: 

pip install time
